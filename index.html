                                        <p>After locking in our Solana mint, fate intervened, and we had the chance to jump on a call with none other than Luca Netz‚Äîthe CEO of Pudgy Penguins. For those of you somehow unfamiliar, Luca is the driving force behind the Pudgies' meteoric rise as the leader in IP, real-world assets (RWA), and mass Web2 adoption within Web3.</p>
                                        <p>Following a great chat, he extended an incredible opportunity: to launch Canna Sapiens on Abstract. After learning more about Abstract and discussing it with our partners, we realized it's the perfect home for us. With that, we made the decision to postpone the mint to accommodate this monumental pivot.</p>

                                        <p class="main-benefit">Abstract will allow us to unite our Cannabis Venture, Creative Flow State (CFS), and NFT/IP licensing all in one place. Everything Canna Sapiens will eventually be available through a simple, user-friendly app, with no worries about blockchain complexities or plugins. This won't just make your Canna Sapiens experience amazing‚Äîit will also make it effortless for new members to join our family. Whether someone discovers us online or walks into a Canna Sapiens shop, they'll be able to enter our world in no time. With Abstract, we'll finally make onboarding as easy and welcoming as we've always dreamed it could be.</p>
